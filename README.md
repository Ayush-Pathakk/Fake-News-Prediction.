#  Diabetes Prediction 🩺
Overview

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. Early detection helps in better treatment and lifestyle management.
This project uses Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine) to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health data.

Dataset

Source: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset – Kaggle/UCI Repository]

Features include: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age.

Target Variable: 0 → Non-Diabetic, 1 → Diabetic

Workflow

Import libraries & load dataset

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features)

Train-test split

Train model using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluate model performance (accuracy score)

Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Results

Model used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Achieved accuracy: ~[Fill with your output accuracy]


Future Improvements

Experiment with additional models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Perform hyperparameter tuning for SVM

Deploy model using Streamlit/Flask API for real-world use
